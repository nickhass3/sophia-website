      Sophia Hass is a classically trained pianist who brings 17 years of
      experience to her piano studio. Currently her students are aged 8-16, but
      anyone is welcome! She has virtual studio recitals where students play
      their best work. She treats each student as a unique individual and crafts
      her lessons as such. Most of all, she wants her students to love music and
      find peace at the piano.
